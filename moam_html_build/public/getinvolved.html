                    <p>The number one thing that would help me in my mission is prayer. Prayer is the basis of everything on this mission, it’s how I start and end my day…it changes things. I need to build up an army of prayer warriors. Prayer is guiding, protecting, balancing, calming, strengthening and nourishing.</p>

                    <p>Keep me informed about how your journey is going, and what is going on where you are. Like all missionaries, a few kind words of encouragement, and small reminders of home and other places help to keep me connected, and remind me that I’ve got a village helping me on my mission.</p>

                    <p>Supporting my ministry is easy and gifts are tax deductible. The fastest way is to make an online donation via www.WorldOutreach.org/donate and select my name from the list (the button below and at the top of this page will open the link for you).  The system can process USA &amp; International cards.  You can also set-up automatic monthly gifts if you select the “Monthly” option.  Or simply mail your gift to World Outreach Ministries, PO Box B, Marietta, GA 30061 and designate it for Jessica Brown #xxx.</p>

                    <p>Monetary donations are always welcome at the Foundation For His Ministry Missions. You can choose to give any amount you want and specify how you'd like it to be used, you can sponsor a child or help to send them to camp, you can give gifts in memory or honor of someone you know, you can plant a tree in the orchard, etc.</p>

                    <span class="reference">(From the FFHM website)</span>
                    <p>A large part of the support the mission receives annually is in the form of gifts-in-kind – new and used items and services that are donated to meet ongoing and specials needs of His Ministry.</p>

                    <p>Visitors to all of the Missions (Baja California, Oaxaca and Michoacan) are welcome to bring items with them to leave at the Mission – and the mission tries to provide a list of current needs. (Please do not send items for Oaxaca and Michoacan to the US warehouse – we cannot ship items to these locations.)</p>

                    <span class="reference">(From the FFHM website)</span>
                    <p>Volunteers have always played a vital part in His Ministry. Visiting work groups from all over Canada, the United States, and beyond, travel thousands of miles to serve. Some groups come year after year. For others, it is the first time they come face to face with poverty, orphaned children, mass evangelism, and the power of the Holy Spirit at work.</p>

                    <p>Some minister to the children in the camps by shampooing and delousing their hair. Visitors pull weeds, can tomatoes, scrub floors, do mountains of mending, work in the “nut house” (macadamia nut processing) and dig ditches.</p>

                    <p>The missions' ministry relies upon people who offer skills not found locally. Service opportunities are for varying lengths of time and always dependent upon available housing.</p>
