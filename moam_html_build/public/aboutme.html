                <h2>My Faith Story&hellip;</h2>
                <p>I was born in a Christian home, and naturally became a Christian when I was 3 years old as my dad prayed with me in my bedroom and I asked Jesus to come into my heart.  Though I went to a private school, attended church with my family, was involved with children’s church and did all of the things that you need to do to be a Christian, it wasn’t until 7th grade that I really understood what that meant.</p>  

                <p>Each year, over spring break, my school sent the 7th and 8th grade class to Monterey, Mexico.  When I was 13 years old it was finally my turn, and it was during this trip that I had my first real experience with Christ.  We spent the day out in a community passing out Bibles and talking to as many people as we could.  Public speaking is not something I am normally comfortable with and public speaking in Spanish (even simply reading out of a handbook) is REALLY not in my comfort zone, but on this day it was the assignment I was given.  We spent the day going door-to-door giving away Bibles and inviting the community to come to the church for an evening service. The service was great, and even though it was in Spanish and I couldn’t necessarily understand the words, it was the first time in my life that I really felt the presence of God.</p>  

                <p>When the preacher was done there was an altar call and my fellow students and I were asked to pray for anyone who came up. While praying for others, is where I heard MY call.  God asked me to become His and I was only too happy to accept. It was here that He told me that one day I would be called.  I didn’t know what that meant until almost 20 years later when I heard Him again, telling me to return to Mexico.</p>


                <h2>Why I’m On This Mission&hellip;</h2>

                <p>While I was working in the clinic at Vincent Guerrero Mission on a recent trip, God spoke to my heart and said “This is where you’re supposed to be.” It isn’t something that you can necessarily describe, it has to be experienced, but once you’ve felt that pull you know you’d give anything to fulfill that desire to serve. After returning to Minnesota, the reality of what I was yearning to do began to set in, and I’ll admit that at first I had some doubts. Could I really leave the job I’ve had for over nine years, pack up some of my things in a trailer, and move to Mexico for a year? Could I truly be of help the way I want to be? Can I learn Spanish medical terms fast enough to work in a clinic full-time? Am I crazy? The more I thought about it, the more I prayed on it, the calmer my brain became, the more excited my heart became, and the clearer it all suddenly was that there wasn’t even a choice. With everything I am, I know that this mission is where I’m meant to be and what I’m called to do. I have felt a calling, and I have no other choice (nor would I ever want one) than to serve where God is leading me.</p>


                <h2>Random Bits About Me&hellip;</h2>
                <ul class="fact-list">
                    <li>I’m not kidding, I would seriously drive 500 miles for Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies. I haven’t had to do that yet, but I can guarantee the trip would be worth it.</li>
                    <li>If you put on a Broadway soundtrack I will be unable to resist the pull and will HAVE to sing and bop around uncontrollably (same goes for any pop songs from the late 90’s&hellip;no shame)</li>
                    <li>I might still have a squeaky pig toy that I’ve had since I was born (though I probably used it as a chew toy as a child, I promise you those days are long behind me).
                    <li>I like to read young adult novels (no judgement, you know you love Harry Potter too!)</li>
                    <li>I have literally driven all over central Minnesota to take pictures of Paul Bunyan and giant animal statues (I have the photos to prove it!)</li>
                    <li>I’m still not entirely positive of what I want to be when I grow up, but I keep hoping I’ll know it when I find it.</li>
                </ul>
